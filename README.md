# Mapping_Earthquake

## Summary
This project is a very complicated project that involves knowledge of Leaflet.js, Javascript, and GeoJSON data. By using d3.json, we can clearly see from the maps of the world, and we can hover over the each circles on the map, we can see a popup information that includes magnitude and location of the earthquake. 
User also are able to zoom in, in a more detailed view, in order to gain a better visualization of the map, getting a concept of where are the most earthquakes takes place (Mostly along the Ring of Fire, or in the United States, San Andreas Fault to be more specific). 

## Purpose
Sometimes, it is hard for people to visualize earthquakes that took place, by showing them layered map with clear hover and pop-up messages, the viewer can clearly see where majority of the earthquakes takes place. Also adding a legend on the upper right corner, like Google Maps, viewer can switch from variety of choices of map views, such as satellite view, streets view and outdoor views, by clicking on three different boxes, viewers can clearly see the tectonic plates boundaries lines, and major earthquakes that took place, this helps the viewers to gain a better understanding of the earthquakes, this is also a very good education opportunities.
